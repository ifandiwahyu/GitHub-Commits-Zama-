- **Repository Name**: `zama-commit-test` (or any name you prefer)
- Set to **Public**
- ‚úÖ Tick "Add a README file"
- Click **Create repository**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open Codespace

- After creating the repository, click the green `<> Code` button.
- Select: **Open with Codespaces ‚Üí + New codespace**
- Wait for Codespace to load (this may take about 20 seconds).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open Terminal in Codespace

Once your Codespace is ready, you will see the main interface. Locate the terminal. You can usually find it in the bottom panel. If it is not visible, you can open it by navigating to the top menu and selecting **Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Following Commands

## üìÖ Schedule Your Commits

To manage your time effectively, consider scheduling your commits. You can plan to make a few commits each day. This approach helps you maintain a consistent workflow.

### Daily Commit Goals

- **Day 1**: Create the repository and make the first three commits.
- **Day 2**: Make the next four commits.
- **Day 3**: Complete the final three commits.

### Benefits of Scheduling

- Reduces the risk of burnout.
- Keeps your project moving forward.
- Allows time for reflection and adjustments.

## üìú Commit Best Practices

- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Keep commits focused on a single change.
- Avoid committing large files directly. Use `.gitignore` for unnecessary files.

### Example of a Good Commit Message

- **Good**: "Fix bug in user authentication"
- **Bad**: "Update files"

### Using Branches

Consider using branches for larger features. This keeps your main branch clean and allows for easier collaboration.

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

After completing your work on the feature, you can merge it back into the main branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

### Conclusion on Commit Practices

Adhering to these best practices will make your GitHub experience smoother and more efficient.
